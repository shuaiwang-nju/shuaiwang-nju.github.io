# Intelligent Speech Technology
**Fall 2025**

## Course Information

**Semester:** Fall 2025  
**Credits:** 2  
**Class Hours:** 36 (18×2)  
**Instructor:** [Shuai Wang](/)  
**Location:** Nanyong Building, Room West 209  
**Time:** Monday 2:00 - 3:50pm

## Course Description

As the most natural form of human communication, intelligent speech technology has given machines the ability to "understand" and "speak". From the emergence of Siri voice assistants to the widespread adoption of smart home and in-car voice systems, and breakthrough developments in multimodal large models like GPT-4o, this technology is profoundly transforming our way of life.

This course will systematically explore the core principles and cutting-edge applications of intelligent speech technology. We will begin with human speech production mechanisms and auditory systems, then delve into traditional technologies including speech recognition, voiceprint modeling, speech synthesis, voice conversion and speech separation, while also examining new developments in speech technology in the era of large language models. The course follows a teaching approach that combines theory with practice, helping students master both theoretical foundations and practical application skills through hands-on projects.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand the fundamental principles of speech signal processing
- Master key technologies in speech recognition, synthesis, and enhancement
- Apply machine learning techniques to speech processing tasks
- Implement practical speech processing applications
- Critically evaluate research papers in the field
- Understand the latest developments in speech technology

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of linear algebra and calculus
- Programming experience in Python
- Familiarity with machine learning concepts
- Basic knowledge of Deep Learning and tools (PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.)
